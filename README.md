# B Taylor - Aspriring Tech Professional

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a **Data Science Fundamentals Bootcamp** with CoGrammar.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the ropes with _python coding, building a tech profile and using tools like VSCode and Guthub._

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my work experience up until this moment! I've had quite the experiences working with Vulnerable Young People. 

- âš¡ Fun fact: I have never lost a dance-off in my life.
