# B Taylor - Aspriring Tech Professional

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a **Data Science Fundamentals Bootcamp** with CoGrammar.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the ropes with _python coding, building a tech profile and using tools like VSCode and Guthub._

- 💬 Ask me about my work experience up until this moment! I've had quite the experiences working with Vulnerable Young People. 

- ⚡ Fun fact: I have never lost a dance-off in my life.
